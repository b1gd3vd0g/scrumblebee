# Scrumblebee

Developed by Devin Peevy

## Overview

**Scrumblebee** is a project management application meant to enhance productivity and increase focus, whether one works on a huge project with a large team, or a small one by themselves. Based on the agile development process Scrum, **Scrumblebee** will make it easier than ever to make the most out of each sprint and ensure progress.

For now, **Scrumblebee** has only basic functionality for managing one's own projects - project sharing between users has yet to be enabled.

## Architecture

**Scrumblebee** is a full-stack JavaScript application that runs in the browser, developed using the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node) stack. The backend is split into a couple microservices - namely user services and project services.
